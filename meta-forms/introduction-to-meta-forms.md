# Introduction to Meta-Forms

The Meta-Forms experience is a combination of Angular code packaged as an App Experience and a Data Model packaged as a Data Experience that enables users to interact with Cinchy data in a User-Friendly manner.

It lives on top of the data collaboration platform, allowing builders to create forms with custom configurations and users to access this data outside of the tabular view that is native to Cinchy.
