## Enhancements

### Platform

### Updated POST endpoint for Saved Queries

The POST endpoint for Saved Queries now automatically serializes hierarchical JSON to text when the content-type is `application/json`. This update now supports values that are objects or arrays.  This update with complex data structures like objects or arrays. This eliminates the need for manual serialization and makes it easier for developers to work with Saved Queries.


#### Extract header values in REST API responses

You can now pull specific data from REST API response headers using .NET regex capture groups. This feature gives you more control and flexibility in collecting the data you need when targeting REST API destinations. For more information, see the [REST API destination](../../data-syncs/supported-data-sync-destinations/rest-api.md) page.

### Connections

#### Drop-down menu for Domain entities

- You can now use drop-down menus for selecting Cinchy tables and queries for both Cinchy sources and destinations. This feature replaces the previous method, where users had to manually type in their selections.

#### Warning added to Schema section for specific Sources and Destinations

- We added a warning to the Schema sections of multiple Sources to mitigate issues due to mismatched column order. This warns users that the column order in the schema must match the source/destination configuration. The changes affect the following data sources:

- LDAP
- Excel
- Binary
- Fixed Width
- Cinchy Query

### Addition of Listener section in triggered Sources for MongoDB Collection (Cinchy Event Triggered) and REST API (Cinchy Event Triggered) Sources

- We added a Listener section to the MongoDB Collection (Cinchy Event Triggered) and REST API (Cinchy Event Triggered) Sources. You can now manage the event trigger within the Connections UI. This reduces the complexity of managing the Listener Config table.

### DataPollingConcurrencyIndex improvements

We improved the implementation of `DataPollingConcurrencyIndex`. Additionally, we added logging around the **Acquire** and **Release** processes to enhance monitoring.

### Model support for Cinchy Table Target

Model support is now available in the Cinchy Table Target within Connections. This feature offers plasticity without the need for defining or calling additional APIs on Cinchy.

### Meta-Forms

## Bugs

### Platform

- We modified the Data Polling mechanism to enhance the reliability of message delivery to Kafka. 
- We fixed a bug in CQL on PostgreSQL that caused the `DATEADD` function to truncate input dates down to `DAY` precision. Now, you can expect more accurate date manipulations without losing finer time details.
- We fixed an issue where the UI failed to display Batch Data Sync results and instead showed a generic exception message. The jobs tab in the UI now opens without any API failure appearing in the browser's network console.
- We resolved an issue that caused large batch delta syncs to fail in Cinchy. 
- We fixed an issue where Cinchy CDC Delete events weren't sent to the destination using Delta. **Deletes** and **Approved Deletes** now successfully insert records into Kafka when deleted from a Cinchy table. 
- We fixed the issue of concurrent updates failing due to a Primary Key (PK) violation on the History table by adding a retry mechanism. This fix aims to make Cinchy more robust when making concurrent updates.
- We resolved an issue during where the Cinchy target would still be queried during a delta sync. 
  
### Connections

- We resolved an issue where the **Load Metadata** button was failing to connect to DB2 databases when fetching schema information.
- We fixed a bug where the model loader failed to update when you added a description to a calculated column. The table now saves correctly when making changes to calculated columns.
- We fixed an issue that prevented table selection from the drop-down in Cinchy Event Broker's listener configuration.
