## Enhancements

### Platform


#### Extracting Data from REST API Response Headers

For REST API destinations, we introduced the ability to capture a single value from the response header using .NET regex capture groups. This enhancement empowers you to precisely extract the data you require from the headers of API responses, providing greater flexibility and control in your data extraction processes.
