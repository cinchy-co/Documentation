## Enhancements

### Platform
#### Extract header values in REST API responses

You can now pull specific data from REST API response headers using .NET regex capture groups. This feature gives you more control and flexibility in collecting the data you need when targeting REST API destinations. For more information, see the [REST API destination](../../data-syncs/supported-data-sync-destinations/rest-api.md) page.

## Bugs

### Platform

- We modified the Data Polling mechanism to enhance the reliability of message delivery to Kafka. This change ensures that `UpdateListenerState` is called after successfully sending messages to Kafka, reducing the risk of message loss.
- We fixed a bug in CQL on PostgreSQL that caused the `DATEADD` function to truncate input dates down to `DAY` precision. Now, you can expect more accurate date manipulations without losing finer time details.

### Connections

- We resolved an issue where the **Load Metadata** button was failing to connect to DB2 databases when fetching schema information.
