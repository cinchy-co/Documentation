## New Capabilities

### New event-based Source - SOAP API (CDC Triggered)

Cinchy now supports a new Cinchy event-triggered source: SOAP API. This new
feature initiates a SOAP call based on Change Data Capture (CDC) events
occurring in Cinchy. The SOAP response then serves as the source for the sync
and can be mapped to any destination.


## Enhancements

### Platform

#### Updated POST endpoint for Saved Queries

The POST endpoint for Saved Queries now automatically serializes hierarchical
JSON to text when the content-type is `application/json`. This update now
supports values that are objects or arrays. This eliminates the need for manual
serialization and makes it easier for developers to work with Saved Queries.

#### Extract header values in REST API responses

You can now pull specific data from REST API response headers using .NET regex
capture groups. This feature gives you more control and flexibility in
collecting the data you need when using REST API destinations. For more
information, see the
[REST API destination](../../data-syncs/supported-data-sync-destinations/rest-api.md)
page.

### Connections

#### Improved Header Row Behavior in delimited files

We improved the user experience for header row settings for delimited files. The following improvements have been added.

- **Use Header Row Checkbox**: Controls visibility of column names and **Load Metadata** button.
- **Schema Columns Warning**: Informs users about column order when header row is disabled.
- **Modal Warning**: Explains schema column reset when disabling header row.
- **Header Record Row Number**: Specifies row to use as header.

#### Added Links to Open Cinchy Tables and Queries in UI

We added clickable links next to Cinchy Tables and Queries referenced in the UI. These links directly open the respective table or query, making navigation more seamless.

#### Drop-down menu for Domain entities

- You can now use drop-down menus for selecting Cinchy tables and queries for
  both Cinchy sources and destinations. This feature replaces the previous
  method, where users had to manually type in their selections.

#### Warning added to Schema section for specific Sources and Destinations

- We added a warning to the Schema sections of multiple Sources to mitigate
  issues due to mismatched column order. This warns users that the column order
  in the schema must match the source/destination configuration. The changes
  affect the following data sources:

- LDAP
- Excel
- Binary
- Fixed Width
- Cinchy Query

#### Addition of Listener section in triggered Sources for MongoDB Collection (Cinchy Event Triggered) and REST API (Cinchy Event Triggered) Sources

- We added a Listener section to the MongoDB Collection (Cinchy Event Triggered)
  and REST API (Cinchy Event Triggered) Sources. You can now manage the event
  trigger within the Connections UI. This reduces the complexity of managing the
  Listener Config table.

#### DataPollingConcurrencyIndex improvements

We improved the implementation of `DataPollingConcurrencyIndex`. Additionally,
we added logging around the **Acquire** and **Release** processes to enhance
monitoring.

#### Model support for Cinchy Table Target

Model support is now available in the Cinchy Table Target within Connections.
This feature offers plasticity without the need for defining or calling
additional APIs on Cinchy.

#### Enhanced JSON Handling for Kafka destinations

Kafka destinations now support more robust JSON field handling, allowing for nested
values within generated Kafka messages. Additionally, data with invalid JSON
formats will be caught and rejected without causing the sync to fail. This
allows for more complex data structures to be accurately represented while also
providing a fail-safe for invalid JSON data. Cinchy now supports the following
features:

- **Nested JSON Support**: Convert JSON in source columns to nested values in
  Kafka messages.
- **Invalid JSON Handling**: Reject rows with invalid JSON without failing the
  sync.

### Meta-Forms

## Bugs

### Platform

- We modified the Data Polling mechanism to enhance the reliability of message
  delivery to Kafka.
- We fixed a bug in CQL on PostgreSQL that caused the `DATEADD` function to
  truncate input dates down to `DAY` precision. Now, you can expect more
  accurate date manipulations without losing finer time details.
- We fixed an issue where the UI failed to display Batch Data Sync results and
  instead showed a generic exception message. The jobs tab in the UI now opens
  without any API failure appearing in the browser's network console.
- We resolved an issue that caused large batch delta syncs to fail in Cinchy.
- We fixed an issue where Cinchy CDC Delete events weren't sent to the
  destination using Delta. For example, **Deletes** and **Approved Deletes** now successfully
  insert records into Kafka when deleted from a Cinchy table.
- We fixed the issue of concurrent updates failing due to a Primary Key (PK)
  violation on the History table by adding a retry mechanism. This fix aims to
  make Cinchy more robust when making concurrent updates.
- We resolved an issue during where the Cinchy destination would still be queried
  during a delta sync.

### Connections

- We resolved an issue where the **Load Metadata** button was failing to connect
  to DB2 databases when fetching schema information.
- We fixed an issue where the Mapping UI would disappear in the Destination Section for Cinchy Event Broker to MongoDB Collection syncs, where **Sync Actions** were set to **Delta**.
- We fixed an issue where system columns like **Created By**, **Created**, **Modified By**, **Modified**, **Deleted**, and **Deleted By** weren't appearing in the topic columns dropdown in the Listener UI.
- We fixed a bug where the model loader failed to update when you added a
  description to a calculated column. The table now saves correctly when making
  changes to calculated columns.
- We fixed an issue that prevented table selection from the drop-down in Cinchy
  Event Broker's listener configuration.
- We fixed a parameter resolution issue in Connections. The
  `ResolveParameters()` function in `Connections.Experience` now receives
  `JobContext` instead of a generic `CinchyClient`.
