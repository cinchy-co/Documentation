### Platform

- We modified the Data Polling mechanism to enhance the reliability of message delivery to Kafka. This change ensures that `UpdateListenerState` is called after successfully sending messages to Kafka, reducing the risk of message loss.
- We fixed a bug in CQL on PostgreSQL that caused the `DATEADD` function to truncate input dates down to `DAY` precision. Now, you can expect more accurate date manipulations without losing finer time details.
