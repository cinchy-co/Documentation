### Platform
#### Extract header values in REST API responses

You can now pull specific data from REST API response headers using .NET regex capture groups. This feature gives you more control and flexibility in collecting the data you need when targeting REST API destinations. For more information, see the [REST API destination](../../data-syncs/supported-data-sync-destinations/rest-api.md) page.

## Bugs

### Platform

- We modified the Data Polling mechanism to enhance the reliability of message delivery to Kafka. This change ensures that `UpdateListenerState` is called after successfully sending messages to Kafka, reducing the risk of message loss.
- We fixed a bug in CQL on PostgreSQL that caused the `DATEADD` function to truncate input dates down to `DAY` precision. Now, you can expect more accurate date manipulations without losing finer time details.
- We fixed an issue where the UI failed to display Batch Data Sync results and instead showed a generic exception message. The jobs tab in the UI now opens without any API failure appearing in the browser's network console.
  
### Connections

- We resolved an issue where the **Load Metadata** button was failing to connect to DB2 databases when fetching schema information.
- We fixed a bug where the model loader failed on subsequent updates when a description was added to a calculated column. The table now saves correctly when making changes to calculated columns.
