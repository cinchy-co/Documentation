### Platform



#### Extract header values in REST API responses

You can now pull specific data from REST API response headers using .NET regex capture groups. This feature gives you more control and flexibility in collecting the data you need when targeting REST API destinations. For more information, see the [REST API destination](../../data-syncs/supported-data-sync-destinations/rest-api.md) page.
