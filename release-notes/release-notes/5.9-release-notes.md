## New Capabilities

## Enhancements

### Platform

### Connections

#### Model support for Cinchy Table destinations

Model support is now available in the Cinchy Table destinations.
This feature offers extensibility without the need for defining or calling
additional APIs on Cinchy.

#### Real-time sync improvements for listener operational status

We've updated the real-time sync feature to improve the way you monitor listener operational status. A new **Running Status** field is now part of the **Listener Config** table, providing a better indicator than the older Status and Message fields. Listeners no longer default to **Disabled** when an error occurs. Instead, the **Running State** updates to **Failed**. For more insights, refer to the [Listener Lifecycle]() page.

### Meta-Forms

#### Improved error resolution for Meta-Forms

We've enhanced the error messaging in forms to provide clearer information, increasing the likelihood you can resolve issues faster and more efficiently.

## Bugs

### Platform

### Connections

- We resolved an issue where CDC to ADO.net syncs weren't using a single sync for all operations. The following changes have been made:
  - **Sync Key Flexibility**: Any standard Cinchy data type can be used as a sync key or ID field.
  - **ID and Sync Key Compatibility**: Setting both to the same field won't cause failure.
  - **Unified Sync Operations**: **Insert**, **Update**, and **Deletes** work in the same sync when specified.
  - **Auto offset Reset**: Consistent behavior for all settings.
  - **Error Messaging**: Clear error messages for missing operation info.
