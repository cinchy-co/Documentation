## New Connector

#### Kafka

We are continuing to improve our Connections offerings, and **we now support** [**Kafka** ](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/what-is-kafka/)**as a data sync target** in Connections.

Apache Kafka is an end-to-end **event streaming platform** that:

* **Publishes** (writes) and **subscribes to** (reads) streams of events from sources like databases, cloud services, and software applications.
* **Stores** these events durably and reliably for as long as you want.
* **Processes and reacts** to the event streams in real-time and retrospectively.

Event streaming thus ensures a continuous flow and interpretation of data so that the right information is at the right place, at the right time [for your key use cases.](https://kafka.apache.org/powered-by)

For information on setting up data syncs with Kafka as a target, [please review the documentation here.](https://cli.docs.cinchy.com/builder-guide/configuring-a-data-sync/supported-sync-targets/kafka-topic)

## New Inbound Data Format for Connections

#### Apache AVRO

We have also added support for [**Apache AVRO (inbound)**](https://avro.apache.org/) as a **data format** and added integration with the Kafka Schema Registry, which helps enforce data governance within a Kafka architecture.

Avro is an open source data serialization system that helps with data exchange between systems, programming languages, and processing frameworks. **Avro stores both the data definition and the data together in one message or file**. Avro stores the data definition in JSON format making it easy to read and interpret; the data itself is stored in **binary format** making it compact and efficient.

Some of the benefits for using AVRO as a data format are:

* It's compact;
* It has a direct mapping to/from JSON;
* It's fast;
* It has bindings for a wide variety of programming languages.

For more about AVRO and Kafka, [read the documentation here. ](https://www.confluent.io/blog/avro-kafka-data/)

For information on configuring AVRO in your platform, [review the documentation here.](https://cli.docs.cinchy.com/builder-guide/configuring-a-data-sync/supported-data-sources/kafka-topic/apache-avro-data-format)

## **Custom Results in the Network Map**

**Focus the results of your Network Map to show only the data that you really want to see** with our new URL parameters.

You can now add **Target Node, Depth Level, and Max Depth Level** Parameters, if you choose.

Example: \<base url>/apps/datanetworkvisualizer?**targetNode=\&maxDepth=\&depthLevel=**

* **Target Node:** Using the Target Node parameter defines which of your nodes will be the central node from which all connections branch from.
  * Target Node uses the **TableID number,** which you can find in the URL of any table.
  * Example: \<base url>/apps/datanetworkvisualizer?**targetNode=8** will show **TableID 8** as the central node
* **Max Depths:** This parameter defines how many levels of network hierarchy you want to display.
  * Example: \<base url>/apps/datanetworkvisualizer?**maxDepth=2** will only show you two levels of connections.
* **Depth Level:** Depth Level is a UI parameter that will highlight/focus on a certain depth of connections.
  * Example: \<base url>/apps/datanetworkvisualizer?**DepthLevel=1** will highlight all first level network connections, while the rest will appear muted.

The below example visualizer uses the following URL: \<base url>/apps/datanetworkvisualizer?**targetNode=8\&maxDepth=2\&depthLevel=1**

* It shows **Table ID 8** ("Groups") as the central node.
* It only displays the **Max Depth of 2** connections from the central node.
* It highlights the nodes that have a **Depth Level of 1** from the central node.

## Enhancements

* We have increased the length of the **\[Parameters]** field in the **\[Cinchy].\[Execution Log]** to **100,000 characters.**
* Two **new parameters** are now available to use in real time syncs that have **a Cinchy Table** as the target. **@InsertedRecordIds()** and **@UpdatedRecordIds()** can be used in post sync scripts to insert and update Record IDs respectively, with the desired value input as comma separated list format.

## Bug Fixes

* We have fixed a bug that was preventing some **new SSO users belonging to existing active directory groups** from seeing tables that they should have access to.
* We have fixed a bug where a **Webhook would return a 400** error if a JSON body was provided, and the key was in the query parameter of the HTTP request.

## GraphQL

* We continue to optimize our[ GraphQL beta](broken-reference) capabilities by **improving memory utilization and performance.**
