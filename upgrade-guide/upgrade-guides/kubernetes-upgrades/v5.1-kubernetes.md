# v5.1 (Kubernetes)

## Upgrading on Kubernetes

When it comes time to upgrade your various components, you can do so by updating the version number in your configuration files and applying the changes in ArgoCD.

### Configure to the newest version

1. Navigate to your **Cinchy devops.automation** repository
   1. Navigate to **your deployment.json** (You may have renamed this during your original Kubernetes deployment)
   2. In the **cinchy\_instance\_configs** section, navigate to the image tags. Replace the _version number_ with the instance that you wish to deploy _(Ex: v5.0.0 > 5.1.0)._

```json
  // The component image tags are specified below to define which versions to deploy
  "connections_image_tag": "v5.1.0",
  "event_listener_image_tag": "v5.1.0",
  "idp_image_tag": "v5.1.0",
  "maintenance_cli_image_tag": "v5.1.0",
  "meta_forms_image_tag": "v5.1.0",
  "web_image_tag": "v5.1.0",
  "worker_image_tag": "v5.1.0"
```

2\. Rerun the deployment script by using the following command in the root directory of your **devops.automations repository**:

```
dotnet Cinchy.DevOps.Automations.dll "deployment.json"
```

3\. Commit and push your changes.

### Apply your Configurations

If your environment isn't set-up to automatically apply upon configuration, complete the following the apply the newest version:

1. Navigate to the **ArgoCD** portal.
2. Refresh your component(s). If that doesn't work, **re-sync.**
