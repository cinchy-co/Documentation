## Upgrading on IIS

The following process can be run when upgrading any v5.x instance to v5.5 on IIS.

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**Warning:**</mark> This release requires you to run the Cinchy Upgrade Utility.[Please review and follow the directives for Upgrade 5.5 here.](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LDtM6UlhGoQ91uwM5SF/s/F1vvLbEMfTF1UqCFU9hs/\~/changes/287/deployment-guide/upgrade-guides/upgrades/cinchy-upgrade-utility)

<mark style="color:red;">**Additionally,**</mark>** If you are upgrading from Cinchy v5.1 or lower to Cinchy v5.5, you must first run a mandatory process (Upgrade 5.2)** [**using the Cinchy Utility**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LDtM6UlhGoQ91uwM5SF/s/F1vvLbEMfTF1UqCFU9hs/\~/changes/287/deployment-guide/upgrade-guides/upgrades/cinchy-upgrade-utility) **and deploy version 5.2.  Once complete, you can continue on with your 5.5 upgrade.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**If you are upgrading to 5.4+ on an SQL Server Database,** you will need to make a change to your `connectionString` in your **SSO and Cinchy appsettings.json**. Adding [**TrustServerCertificate=True**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnectionstringbuilder.trustservercertificate?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0) will allow you to bypass the certificate chain during validation.

Ex:

```json
"SqlServer" : "Server=MyServer;Database=Cinchy;User ID=cinchy;Password=password;Trusted_Connection=False;Connection Timeout=30;Min Pool Size=10;TrustServerCertificate=True"
```
{% endhint %}

### Prerequisites

1. Take a backup of your database.
2. Extract the[ new build ](https://platform.docs.cinchy.com/deployment-guide/deployment-guides/deployment-planning-overview-and-checklist/deployment-prerequisites#4.1-access-the-artifacts) for the version you wish to upgrade to.
3. [Download .NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

### Upgrade process

1. Merge the following configs with your current instance configs:
   * **Cinchy/web.config**
   * **Cinchy/appsettings.json**
   * **CinchySSO/appsettings.json**
   * **CinchySSO/web.config**
2.  **If you are upgrading to 5.5 on an SQL Server Database and didn't do so in any previous updates,** you will need to make a change to your `connectionString` in both your **SSO and Cinchy appsettings.json**. Adding [**TrustServerCertificate=True**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnectionstringbuilder.trustservercertificate?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0) will allow you to bypass the certificate chain during validation.

    Ex:

    ```json
    "SqlServer" : "Server=MyServer;Database=Cinchy;User ID=cinchy;Password=password;Trusted_Connection=False;Connection Timeout=30;Min Pool Size=10;TrustServerCertificate=True"
    ```
3. Execute the following command:

```bash
iisreset -stop 
```

4.  Replace the **Cinchy** and **CinchySSO** folders with the new build and your merged configs.

5. Execute the following command:

```bash
