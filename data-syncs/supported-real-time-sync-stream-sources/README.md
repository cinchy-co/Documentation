# Supported Real-Time Sync Stream Sources

## 1. Overview

Sync Stream Sources are an integral part of the real-time sync experience in Connections, and must be configured prior to executing your data sync.

Stream Sources are configured and enabled via the Listener Configuration table in Cinchy.

While a Stream Source can feasibly be configured at any point during the creation of a real-time data sync, we recommend that you do so as a final step after setting up your Source, Destination, and any other relevant additional settings.
