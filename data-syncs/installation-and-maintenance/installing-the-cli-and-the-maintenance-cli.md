# Installing the CLI and the Maintenance CLI

## Overview

The **Command Line Interface (CLI)** offers utilities to get data in and out of Cinchy.

The **Maintenance CLI** was formerly _(prior to v5)_ packaged together with the CLI. It can be used to perform maintenance tasks such as data erasure and data compression deletions. For a full list of CLI commands, [review the documentation here.](../cli-commands-list.md)
