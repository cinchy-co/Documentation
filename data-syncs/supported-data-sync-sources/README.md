### Binary File

A binary file is a computer file that is **not a text file**, and whose content is in a binary format consisting of a series of sequential bytes, each of which is eight bits in length.

You can use binary files from a **Local upload, Amazon S3, or Azure Blob Storage** in your data syncs.

Some benefits of using binary files include:

* **Better efficiency via compression**
* **Better Security** through the ability to create custom encoding standards.
* **Unmatched Speed,** since the data is stored in a raw format, and is not encoded using any character encoding standards, it is faster to read and store.

### Fixed Width File

A **fixed width file** is a file that has a specific format which allows for the saving of information in an organized fashion. The data is arranged in rows and columns, with one entry per row. Each column has a fixed width, specified in characters, which determines the maximum amount of data it can contain. No delimiters are used to separate the fields in the file.

Advantages of using a fixed width file include:

* It is a very **compact** representation of your data
* It is fast to parse because every field is in the same place in every line

### Kafka Topic

[Apache Kafka ](https://kafka.apache.org/intro)is an end-to-end **event streaming platform** that:

* **Publishes** (writes) and **subscribes to** (reads) streams of events from sources like databases, cloud services, and software applications.
* **Stores** these events durably and reliably for as long as you want.
* **Processes and reacts** to the event streams in real-time and retrospectively.

Those events are organized and durably stored in **topics.** These topics are then partitioned over a number of buckets located on different Kafka brokers.&#x20;

Event streaming thus ensures a continuous flow and interpretation of data so that the right information is at the right place, at the right time [for your key use cases.](https://kafka.apache.org/powered-by)

### LDAP

[LDAP](https://www.techtarget.com/searchmobilecomputing/definition/LDAP) **(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** is a mature, flexible, and well supported standards-based mechanism software protocol for enabling anyone to locate data whether on the public internet or on a corporate intranet.

Common uses of LDAP include when:

* A single piece of data needs to be found and accessed regularly;
* Your organization has a lot of smaller data entries;
* Your organization wants all smaller pieces of data in one centralized location, and there doesn't need to be an extreme amount of organization between the data.

### REST API

A REST API is an application programming interface that conforms to the constraints of REST (representational state transfer) architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.

REST APIs work by fielding **requests for a resource** and **returning all relevant information** about the resource, translated into a format that clients can easily interpret (this format is determined by the API receiving requests). Clients can also **modify** items on the server and even **add new items** to the server through a REST API.
