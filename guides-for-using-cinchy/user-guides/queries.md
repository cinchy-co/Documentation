# Queries

## Create queries

[Cinchy Builders](../builder-guides/) and Users have the capability to create ad-hoc queries, however only Cinchy Users can create saved queries. For more information on how to create queries, see [creating a saved query.](https://platform.docs.cinchy.com/guides-for-using-cinchy/builder-guides/saved-queries#2.-creating-a-saved-query)

## Execute queries

Cinchy Users can execute pre-built queries based on their access.

You can find a list of saved queries on your network by navigating to the **Saved Queries table** _(Image 1)._ You can then **search the Cinchy homepage** for the saved query to execute it.

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need **"Execute Access"** for each Saved Query that you want to run. You can find this information in the **Saved Queries** table.
{% endhint %}

## 3. Generating Pivot Tables <a href="#generate-pivot-tables" id="generate-pivot-tables"></a>

Once you have executed the query, click the Grid drop down list and select Pivot. Here is where you can take your standard table view and slice and dice your data _(Image 2)._

## 4. Generating Charts <a href="#generate-charts" id="generate-charts"></a>

From within your pivot view, open the drop down list with the value “table” and select the type of chart you want to use to display the data _(Image 3)._

## 5. Building Shared Visualizations

Once you have a desired visualization, that visualization can be made available for others as an applet in Cinchy. **Grab the Pivot URL and send it to your Cinchy builder** to create your mini applet that can be shared and leveraged!

To copy the Pivot URL to build have a visualization created, complete the following:

1. From within the Pivot, locate the **blue Pivot URL**
2. Click **Pivot URL button**
3. Click the **Copy button**
4. Send the copied URL to your Cinchy builder to create your applet that can be shared and leveraged!

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also open that visualization by clicking Open in new tab.
{% endhint %}
