# User Guides

## What is an End-User?

The **“End-Users”** of the Cinchy platform are those that apply the functionalities created by the **“Cinchy Builders”** to their business objectives. This can be employees, customers, partners, or systems. There are two types of end-user: direct and indirect.

* **Direct Users** log into Cinchy via the data browser
* **Indirect Users** (also commonly referred to as "external users") view/edit data via a third-party application/page that connects to Cinchy via API

{% hint style="info" %}
All Builders are also End-Users, but not all End-Users are Builders.
{% endhint %}

## What Can End-Users Do?

Cinchy End-Users are able to:

* Create and save personal queries. Unlike traditional saved queries made by builders, _**personal**_ saved queries cannot be shared and are not auto-exposed as APIs.
* Use Tables, Saved Queries, and Experiences created by [“Builders"](../builder-guides/#what-is-a-builder)
* Track version history for the full lifecycle of data
* Bookmark and manage data
* Access data through application experiences
* An end-user can be part of the [Administrators group](../administrator-guide.md)

### **View and Manage Data Through a Single UI**

Cinchy’s Dataware platform features a Universal Data Browser that allows users to view, change, analyze, and otherwise interact with all data on the network. The Data Browser even enables non-technical business users to manage and update data, build models, and set controls, all through an easy and intuitive UI.

### **Only See the Data You Have Been Granted Access**

Data on the network is protected by cellular-level access controls, data-driven entitlements, and superior data governance. This means that users can only view, edit, or operationalize data that has been granted access to from the data owner _(Image 1)._

### **Track Version History for Full Lifecycle of Data**

All data is automatically version-controlled and can easily be reverted to previous states with the proper permissions. On all data tables, you can see changes made by users, systems, or external applications through Data Synchronization or by using a Collaboration Log _(Image 2)._

### **Access Saved Queries on the Data Network**

Users can easily access and run saved queries that are available to them through the Data Marketplace. All queries respect Universal Access Controls meaning you will only see the data that you have access to _(Image 3)._

### **Bookmark and Manage Data in a Secure Marketplace**

Users can also access all accessible tables, queries, and applets through the Cinchy Marketplace. Here you can also order tiles and bookmark favourites _(Image 4)._

### **Access Data through Rich Application Experiences**

Users can also experience their data through custom application experiences that are created by Builders on the platform. All application experiences also respect Universal Access Controls meaning you will only be able to see the data you have been granted access.

Here is an example Experience _(Image 5):_
