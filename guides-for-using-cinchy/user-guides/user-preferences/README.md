### My Password <a href="#my-password" id="my-password"></a>

If you don't see the password option in **My Profile**, you must be logging on to Cinchy using Single Sign-On and won't need to update your password within Cinchy.​

To change your password, complete the following:

1. In the **Old Password** field, enter in your existing password
2. In the **New Password** field, enter a new password
3. In the **Confirm New Password** field, re-enter in your new password

Your Cinchy password must conform to the [requirements set by your administrator.](../../additional-guides/system-properties.md#minimum-password-length)
{% endhint %}
