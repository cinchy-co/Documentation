# MDQE

## 1. Overview

MDQE, which stands for **Metadata Quality Exceptions**, can send out notifications based on a set of rules and the “exceptions” that break them. This powerful tool can be used to send notifications for exceptions such as:

* Healthchecks returning a critical status
* Upcoming Project Due Dates/Timelines
* Client Risk Ratings reaching a high threshold
* Tracking Ticket Urgency or Status markers
* Unfulfilled and Pending Tasks/Deliverables
* Etc.

In a nutshell, MDQE monitors for specific changes in data, and then pushes out notifications when that change occurs.

## 2. Prerequisites

* You will need to have the [Cinchy CLI installed.](https://cli.docs.cinchy.com/installation-guide)
* Request the installation package from the [Cinchy Support team.](../../getting-help.md)

## 3. Installing MDQE

To install MDQE in your Cinchy environment, follow the below steps:

1. **Download** the MDQE Installation package.
2. **Unzip** the file.
3. Open an instance of Powershell as an Administrator and navigate to the path where you extracted the **MDQE package in step 2 > Metadata Quality Exceptions V.x > Metadata Quality Exceptions.**
4. **Run the following command** to install all MDQE components in your environment, using the table below as a parameter guide.

```
.\CinchyDXD.ps1 install `
-s "url.com/Cinchy" `
-sso "url.com/CinchySSO" `
-u "CinchyDQE" `
-p "cinchy" `
-c "C:\Cinchy CLI\Cinchy CLI v4.12.0.564" `
-d "C:\Cinchy CLI\Cinchy CLI Error Logs" `
-y
```

## 4. Creating MDQE Rules

1. In the environment where you installed MDQE, search for and open the **\[Cinchy MDQE].\[Rules] table.**
2. Using the “Create Rule” view and the following data, create your Rule:

Use “Never” if you do not want email notifications sent out.<br><br><em>Example: Daily</em><br><br><strong>Note : In case you would like to define your own Notification frequency, use [Cinchy MDQE].[Notification schedule] table.You would need admin privileges to view this table</strong></p> |

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the “Invalid Rules” view to correct Rules with have syntax errors
{% endhint %}

## 5. Viewing All Exceptions

All exceptions can be viewed in the \[Cinchy MDQE].\[Data Quality Exceptions] table

* The **Default** view only displays exceptions assigned to the currently logged in user.
* The **All Data** view displays all exceptions. This is only visible with admin privileges.

## 6. Debugging

Ways to debug your rules:

* If your Powershell scripts aren't running: Run the script files in the Powershell - DQE Orchestration folder **using an IDE** to make sure that all the configurations are correct.
* Check to see if your bugged Rule is part of the **“Invalid Rules”** view.
* If you have admin privileges, check to see if an equivalent SQL statement has been created in **the \[Rules CQL] table.**
* Check if there is a row for the Rule’s Signature value in the **\[Cinchy].\[Formatting Rules] table.**

## 7. Scheduling MDQE Jobs

You can use the Windows Task Scheduler to run MDQE jobs at regular intervals.

1. Navigate to your **MDQE installation package > Windows Task Scheduler Jobs folder.**
2. Import the files into the Windows Task Scheduler, updating the parameters accordingly.
