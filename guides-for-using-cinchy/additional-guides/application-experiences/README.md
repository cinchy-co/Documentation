# Application Experiences

Rather than traditional code-centric applications which creates data silos, you can build meta-data driven application experiences directly on the Cinchy platform. These look and feel like regular applications, but persists its data on the data network autonomously, rather than managing its own persistence.

These experiences automatically adapt as your data evolves _(Image 1)._

Once you deploy your UI, API and logic, you will need to create an integrated client to leverage the data fabric for persistence and controls. If you would like a link to your experience from the data fabric, you will need to create an Experience in the Applets table. See [Setting Up Experiences](setting-up-experiences.md) to see how to set up both. The Cinchy Platform also comes with a built-in Experience called My Data Network, this is a tool to help you visualize your data through its connections. You can read more about[ ](https://platform.docs.cinchy.com/deployment-guide/installation/data-experiences/setup-data-network-visualizer)the [Network Map](network-map/) or create your own [custom data network visualizer ](network-map/custom-node-results.md)on your own data.
