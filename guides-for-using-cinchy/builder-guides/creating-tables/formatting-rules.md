  You can apply conditional formatting rules. Our first iteration of this is
  done directly in the Formatting Rules table. A future iteration will add a UI
  within a table to create them.

# Formatting Rules

## 1. Columns

There are formatting rules for columns:

### 1.1 Row Condition

This follows the same syntax as a view filter query.

### 1.2 Ordinal

Order in which the formatting rules will apply on the same table. Ordinal 1 will show up above ordinal 2.

### 1.3 Highlight Color

Color to highlight the cell. If you want to add your own colors you can do so within System Colours and check off highlight under usage.

### 1.4 Table

Table in which to apply the conditional formatting.

### 1.5 Highlight Columns

Columns to apply the conditional formatting rules to. You don't need to include any row condition columns within the highlight columns.
