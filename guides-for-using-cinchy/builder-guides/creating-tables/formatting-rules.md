  You can apply conditional formatting rules. Our first iteration of this is

# Formatting Rules

## Columns

This section has formatting rules available for columns.

### Row Condition

This follows the same syntax as a view filter query.

### Ordinal

Order in which the formatting rules will apply on the same table. Ordinal 1 will show up above ordinal 2.

### Highlight Color

Color to highlight the cell. If you want to add your own colors you can do so within System Colours and check off highlight under usage.

### Table

Table in which to apply the conditional formatting.

### Highlight Columns

Columns to apply the conditional formatting rules to. You don't need to include any row condition columns within the highlight columns.
