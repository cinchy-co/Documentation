# Data Experience Reference Table

The following table lists the properties in the **Data Experience Reference** Table.

| Column                     | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name                       | This is the Name of your Reference Data Table, note this name can be anything and doesn't have to replicate the actual table name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Ordinal                    | The ordinal number assigned will identify the order in which the data is loaded and required based on dependencies within the data experience. For example if you have tables that have hierarchies in them, you will need to load the parent records first and then load your child records which would then resolve any links in the table.                                                                                                                                            |
| Filter                     | This is where a WHERE clause would be required. For example, if you have a table that has hierarchies, you would require two rows within the Data Experience Reference Data table. One to load the parent data and one to load the children data. In the parent record a filter WHERE clause would be needed to filter all parent records. In the second record in the filter column a WHERE clause in another in the second record that would be needed to filter the children records. |
| New Records                | Identify the behaviour of a new record (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, IGNORE)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Change Records             | Identify the behaviour of a changed record (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, IGNORE)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Dropped Records            | Identify the behaviour of a dropped record (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, IGNORE)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Table                      | Identify the table that you are exporting data from                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
