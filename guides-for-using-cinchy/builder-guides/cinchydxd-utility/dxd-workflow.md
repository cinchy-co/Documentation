# CinchyDXD 2.0 workflow

## Overview

The CinchyDXD 2.0 workflow depends on four system tables within Cinchy:

1. [**Data Experience Definitions Table**](/guides-for-using-cinchy/builder-guides/cinchydxd-utility/References/data-experience-definitions.md): This is where you define the data experience. This includes tables, queries, views, formatting rules, and user defined functions (UDFs).
3. **Data Experience Releases Table:** Once a Data Experience is exported, an entry is created in this table for the export containing:
2. [**Data Experience Reference Data Table**](/guides-for-using-cinchy/builder-guides/cinchydxd-utility/References/data-experience-reference.md):This table defines data that must move with the data experience for it to function. This includes lookup values and static values that might exist in tablesâ€”it typically would not be the physical data itself. It also includes the following items:
   * **Version Number**
   * **Release Binary**
   * **Release Name**
   * **Data Experience**
4. **Data Experience Release Artifact Table**: Stores all files that are part of the Data Experience package as individual records along with the binary for each record.

## Basic workflow 

The basic workflow for using CinchyDXD 2.0 is the following:

1. Define your data references in the **Data Experience Definitions** table. This definition creates a GUID.
1. Create the references to data you want to move with the data experience in the **Data Experience Releases** table.
1. Package the data experience in PowerShell using .\CinchyDXD.ps1
1. Upload the package to a version control system for further development work.
