# Best practices

## Naming convention <a href="#naming-convention" id="naming-convention"></a>

‌Cinchy is a simple, business user friendly application. This means that you should use business friendly terms to name your tables and columns. For example, you want to name a column `Full Name` rather than `full_name`, `fullName`, or `fName`. 

## Domains <a href="#domains" id="domains"></a>

‌Domains essentially act as folders to be able to organize your data. Most users will want to split domains by business lines, such as Sales, Marketing, and Human Resources. The key thing is to keep it consistent so users have a general idea where to go to find information.‌‌

## Descriptions <a href="#descriptions" id="descriptions"></a>

‌You can add descriptions to your tables and columns. Descriptions lets users access data in a more self-serve fashion, and also helps prevent misunderstandings of the meaning of your data.‌‌ Table descriptions are shown in the **My Network** screen, and will show up in search as well.‌ _(Image 1)._

Column descriptions show up when you hover on the column in the Manage Data screen _(Image 2 and 3)._
