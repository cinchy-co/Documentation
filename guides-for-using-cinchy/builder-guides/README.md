# Builder Guides

## 1. What is a Builder?

**“Cinchy Builders”** use the Cinchy platform to build an unlimited number of business capabilities and use-cases.

The “Cinchy Builder” has access to perform the following capabilities:

* Change Table Schema (use Cinchy’s “Design Table” functionality)
* Grant access (use Cinchy’s “Design Controls” functionality)
* Edit Cinchy Data in Cinchy System Tables
* Create, Save, and Share Cinchy Queries
* Perform ad hoc Cinchy Queries on the Cinchy data network
* Import/export packaged business capabilities (i.e. deployment packages)
* Build Cinchy Experiences
* Perform integration with Cinchy (e.g. Cinchy Command Line Interface \[CLI] operations)
* Create and Deliver an unlimited number of Customer Use Cases within Cinchy
* A builder can be part of the[ Administrators group](../administrator-guide.md)

The **“End-Users”** of the Cinchy platform are those that use the functionalities created by the **“Cinchy Builders”** to their business objectives.&#x20;

All Builders are also End-Users, but not all End-Users are Builders.

[**“End-Users”**](../user-guides/) of the Cinchy Platform can:

* Use Tables, Saved Queries, and Experiences created by “Builders”

## 2. What do Builders Do?

**Builders can leverage Cinchy as one platform to simplify solutions delivery as they:**

1. Connect
2. Protect
3. Collaborate
4. Build
5. Reuse

### **Connect**

#### **Create your new network of data**

Dataware eliminates point-to-point integration, reducing cost and complexity (including real-time, batch, on-prem, cloud, legacy, and SaaS services) and allowing custom data-sync configurations. This drives faster time to market, lower costs and improved usability.

#### **Connect data to make silos and integration obsolete**

Once a data source is connected to your data network, its data can be used in conjunction with data from any other source on the network with no further integration efforts. The more sources you connect, the more powerful and efficient it becomes. You can extend data on the network with attributes and entirely new entities, including calculated data, derived data, AI models, and user-managed data.

### **Protect**

#### **Manage and protect data down to the individual cell**

Data on Cinchy is protected by cellular-level access controls, data-driven entitlements, and superior data governance. This includes meta architecture, versioning, and write-specific business functions that restrict user views, such as a managed hierarchy. Owner-defined permissions are universally enforced, significantly reducing the effort of managing them at the enterprise level. You can use existing Active Directory and SSO access policies to set controls for an individual user, external system, or user-defined functions (such as approving updates row by row or using bulk approvals).

### **Collaborate**

#### Track version history for full lifecycle of data

All data is automatically version-controlled and can easily be reverted to previous states. You can see changes made by users, systems, or external applications through Data Synchronization or by using a Collaboration Log.

#### **View and manage data through a single UI**

Use the universal Data Browser to view, change, analyze, and otherwise interact with ALL data on the Fabric. Non-technical business users can manage and update data, build models, and set controls, all through an easy and intuitive UI.

### **Build**

#### **Create and share queries**&#x20;

Cinchy’s Dataware platform features an intuitive Drag and Drop Query Builder that allows Builders to create using the Cinchy Query Language ([CQL](https://cinchy.gitbook.io/cql/)), a proprietary language specific to Cinchy. All queries can be easily saved and shared, and query results automatically generate a full no-code API.

#### **Consolidate legacy systems, create new solutions**

By decoupling the data from the application, our Autonomous Data Network lets you consolidate legacy applications to increase operational agility and reduce overhead. You can create enterprise-grade solutions using the Application SDK as quickly and easily as you would build Excel-based solutions and without the operational risk. Application SDK (React Native, Angular, and REST SDKs) lets you build custom applications for end users.

#### **Add third-party visualization tools**

For even more flexibility, connect your Data Network to third-party Data Visualization tools. You’ll be able to run cross-queries against all data on the Fabric while maintaining universal access policies for users, systems, and external applications.

#### **Re-use**

The more you use Dataware the more it’s capable of doing.

Any new data you add to the network will work in conjunction with any previously existing data, instantly and easily. This means you can re-use data in new ways, with no time-consuming integration efforts. Teams can collaborate directly in real-time, allowing it to act as a central data hub while simplifying integration. Unlike traditional data architecture projects, which grow more complicated as they involve more data sources, dataware delivers solutions faster and faster as more data is added to it.&#x20;
