# Overview

### Cinchy Query Language (CQL) <a href="#1.-introduction" id="1.-introduction"></a>

Cinchy Query Language (CQL) is a specialized query language designed for managing and retrieving data and metadata across multiple tables in your network, consolidating it into single, actionable outputs. With CQL, you can:

- Use the query editor for tasks like data retrieval or modification.
- Work with table views.
- Manage table indexes.

For a comprehensive list, [see the CQL functions master list.​](cql-functions-master-list.md) for details.

{% hint style="success" %}
All CQL queries are secured by default through universal data access controls. This ensures you only access data you're authorized to see.
{% endhint %}

### Basic rules <a href="#2.-basic-rules-of-cql" id="2.-basic-rules-of-cql"></a>

CQL, unique to Cinchy, shares similarities with SQL and PGSQL but has key differences. The following list guides you through some key differences:

#### Streamline your CQL queries with Query Builder

Cinchy's Query Builder UI pre-fills basic syntax to expedite your query process. Add terms manually or via drag-and-drop. More details can be found on the [Saved Queries page](https://cinchy.gitbook.io/guides-for-using-cinchy/builder-guides/saved-queries).

![Query example.](https://762429502-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MBtHkNqYteSDPDzpqqZ%2Fuploads%2FXPwQAuVPRZiEd8cM1N6p%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=90cfce6d-cc3f-46dd-98a1-8392b7d88938)

#### Built-in exclusion of deleted data
Queries generated by the Query Builder automatically exclude deleted data with a "WHERE [Deleted] IS NULL" clause. Remove the clause to include deleted records.

#### Syntax for table queries

Always use the "[Domain].[Table]" format when querying tables. For instance, querying the _Product Content Backlog_ table would follow the **[Product].[Product Content Backlog]** syntax.

#### Syntax for linked columns

For linked columns, employ the "[Column Name].[Linked Column Name]" format.
- Example: To extract **[Full Name]** from the **Users** table through a linked column **Requester**, use **[Requester].[Full Name]**.

```sql
SELECT [Requester].[Full Name]
FROM [Product].[Product Content Backlog]
WHERE [Deleted] IS NULL
```

#### Multi-level links

You can access nested linked columns using extended syntax, like **[Column Name].[Linked Column Name].[Linked Column Name]**. For example, if you wanted to see the _Manager ID_ of a specific employee, use **[Employee].[Reports To].[Employee ID]** to find the employee, who they report to, and their ID number.

```sql
SELECT [Employee].[Reports To].[Employee ID]
FROM [Employee Success].[Employees]
WHERE [Deleted] IS NULL
```
#### Query essentials

- For text or string data, encapsulate the text with single quotes, as in **[Domain] = 'Sandbox'**.
- Use **!=** to specify "not equal to,". For example, **[Domain] != 'Sandbox'**.

#### Draft and version handling
- Query draft rows using **Draft([Column Name])**. Also include **[Column Name]** for non-draft rows.
- Default sorting is ascending unless specified.
- In boolean queries, **1** means true, **0** means false.
- Cinchy splits version numbers differently. Use **Version** and **Draft Data** to specify, like `\[Version]: 2` and `\[Draft Data]: 5`.

#### Error and syntax guidance

- Errors will show in the Query Builder’s results pane.
- For **INSERT INTO**, ensure column and value order matches.

#### System and link-related queries

- A **\*** after **SELECT** returns system columns for each entry.
- Use **RESOLVELINK** for linked column values. Syntax: _ResolveLink('value(s)','column in target table')_.

```sql
INSERT INTO [Human Resources].[Employee RY] ([First Name], [Last Name], [Employee ID], [Manager])
VALUES (@FirstName, @LastName, @EmployeeID, (RESOLVELINK(@Manager, ‘Full Name’))
```


### Query return results <a href="#3.-query-return-results" id="3.-query-return-results"></a>

You can specify what your results return as in the Query Builder

#### Query result options

The table below lists what your results can return:

| Options                                    | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Approved Data (Default)**                | Returns table data that is approved. Ideal for use with external APIs.                                          |
| **Draft Data**                             | Displays records that are pending approval.                                                                    |
| **With History**                           | Includes historical data for all tables, capturing all changes within the query's scope.                       |
| **Row Count**                              | Indicates the number of rows affected if the last statement is an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.                    |
| **DDL Commands**                           | For queries with DDL (Data Definition Language) commands like CREATE, ALTER, DROP.                              |
| **Single Value**                           | Provides a single value, the first column of the first row, irrespective of query size.                         |
### Data return types <a href="#3.-data-return-types" id="3.-data-return-types"></a>

The following tables show the data types that a **Cinchy Data Type** translates to in the database:

| Number     | Text     | Date     |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| Int        | NVarChar | DateTime |
| BigInt     | VarChar  | Date     |
| Decimal    | Char     | ​        |
