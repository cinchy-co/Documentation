# Overview

### Cinchy Query Language (CQL) <a href="#1.-introduction" id="1.-introduction"></a>

Cinchy Query Language (CQL) is a specialized query language designed for managing and retrieving data and metadata across multiple tables in your network, consolidating it into single, actionable outputs. With CQL, you can:

- Use the query editor for tasks like data retrieval or modification.
- Work with table views.
- Manage table indexes.

For a comprehensive list, [see the CQL functions master list.​](cql-functions-master-list.md) for details.

{% hint style="success" %}
All CQL queries are secured by default through universal data access controls. This ensures you only access data you're authorized to see.
{% endhint %}

### Basic rules <a href="#2.-basic-rules-of-cql" id="2.-basic-rules-of-cql"></a>

CQL, unique to Cinchy, shares similarities with SQL and PGSQL but has key differences. The list below defines the foundational elements of CQL.

#### Query Builder UI

Cinchy's Query Builder UI pre-fills basic syntax to speed up your query process. You can add terms manually or drag onto the Query Builder. More details can be found on the [Saved Queries page](https://cinchy.gitbook.io/guides-for-using-cinchy/builder-guides/saved-queries).

![Query example.](https://762429502-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MBtHkNqYteSDPDzpqqZ%2Fuploads%2FXPwQAuVPRZiEd8cM1N6p%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=90cfce6d-cc3f-46dd-98a1-8392b7d88938)

#### Built-in exclusion of deleted data
Queries generated by the Query Builder automatically exclude deleted data with a "WHERE [Deleted] IS NULL" clause. Remove the clause to include deleted records.

#### Syntax for table queries

Always use the "[Domain].[Table]" format when querying tables. For instance, querying the _Product Content Backlog_ table would follow the **[Product].[Product Content Backlog]** syntax.

#### Syntax for linked columns

For linked columns, employ the "[Column Name].[Linked Column Name]" format.
- Example: To extract **[Full Name]** from the **Users** table through a linked column **Requester**, use **[Requester].[Full Name]**.

```sql
SELECT [Requester].[Full Name]
FROM [Product].[Product Content Backlog]
WHERE [Deleted] IS NULL
```

#### Multi-level links

You can access nested linked columns using extended syntax, like **[Column Name].[Linked Column Name].[Linked Column Name]**. For example, if you wanted to see the _Manager ID_ of a specific employee, use **[Employee].[Reports To].[Employee ID]** to find the employee, who they report to, and their ID number.

```sql
SELECT [Employee].[Reports To].[Employee ID]
FROM [Employee Success].[Employees]
WHERE [Deleted] IS NULL
```
#### Query essentials

- For text or string data, encapsulate the text with single quotes, as in **[Domain] = 'Sandbox'**.
- Use **!=** to specify **Not equal to**. For example, **[Domain] != 'Sandbox'**.

#### Draft and version handling
- Query draft rows using **Draft([Column Name])**. Also include **[Column Name]** for non-draft rows.
- Default sorting is ascending unless specified.
- In Boolean queries, **1** means true, **0** means false.
- In Cinchy, version history labeling diverges from standard SQL systems. While typical systems use a single label like "version 1.2.4," Cinchy breaks this into two components: Version and Draft Data. These serve as **ORDER BY** options. For example, if Version is `2` and Draft Data is `5`, the complete version is denoted as `2.5`.

#### Error and syntax guidance

- Errors will show in the Query Builder’s results pane.
- For **INSERT INTO**, ensure column and value order matches.

#### System and link-related queries

- A **\*** after **SELECT** returns system columns for each entry.
- Use **RESOLVELINK** for linked column values. Syntax: _ResolveLink('value(s)','column in target table')_.

```sql
INSERT INTO [Human Resources].[Employee RY] ([First Name], [Last Name], [Employee ID], [Manager])
VALUES (@FirstName, @LastName, @EmployeeID, (RESOLVELINK(@Manager, ‘Full Name’))
```


### Query return results <a href="#3.-query-return-results" id="3.-query-return-results"></a>

You can specify what your results return as in the Query Builder

#### Query result options

The table below lists what your results can return:

| Query return result                          | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Query Result (Approved Data Only)**        | Default return type. Returns table data that's approved. Ideal for use with external APIs.                                                                   |
| **Query Result (Including Draft Data)**      | Displays records that are pending approval.                                                                                                                  |
| **Query Result (Including Version History)** | Returns a table from a SELECT query with only draft data for tables with **Change Approval** enabled. Use this to display records that are pending approval. |
| **Number of Rows Affected**                  | Returns a single string response of the number of rows affected if the last statement is an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.                                       |
| **Execute DDL Script**                       | For queries with DDL (Data Definition Language) commands like CREATE, ALTER, DROP.                                                                           |
| **Single Value**                             | Returns a result of 1 row x 1 column, irrespective of the underlying result set.                                                                             |
### Data return types <a href="#3.-data-return-types" id="3.-data-return-types"></a>

The following tables show the data types that a **Cinchy Data Type** translates to in the database:

| Number     | Text     | Date     |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| Int        | NVarChar | DateTime |
| BigInt     | VarChar  | Date     |
